Templating concept with Twig in Symfony 4:

1) template file name should be end with extension '.html.twig' or '.xml.twig'. But prefered one is '.html.twig'
2) template should be placed under /templates directory. 
3) we can add sub directory and add templates within /templates directory.
4) template file and directory should be snake_case. For example : (e.g. blog_posts.twig, admin/default_theme/blog/index.twig)
5) Possible to change the default template directory by define to variable ' twig.default_path' in twig.yml file. 
6) Twig syntax is based on these three constructs:
   => {{ ... }}, used to display the content of a variable or the result of evaluating an expression;
   => {% ... %}, used to run some logic, such as a conditional or a loop;
   => {# ... #}, used to add comments to the template (unlike HTML comments, these comments are not included in the rendered page).
 
7) To call the template to any action, using the below command. 

return $this->render('user/notifications.html.twig', [
            // this array defines the variables passed to the template,
            // where the key is the variable name and the value is the variable value
            // (Twig recommends using snake_case variable names: 'foo_bar' instead of 'fooBar')
            'user_first_name' => $userFirstName,
            'notifications' => $userNotifications,
        ]);
