1) Create model using artisan

php artisan make:model Flight


Notes:
1) Create model File 
   => php artisan make:model Category

2) If you use table name as model name's plural. No need to mention in model. Otherwise need to mention table name in model. For ex: you use cars_category table.
   => protected $table = 'cars_category';

3) In default, Laravel consider the primary key column name is 'id', if you are using different key, you need to mention primary key in model. 
   => protected $primaryKey = 'category_id';
